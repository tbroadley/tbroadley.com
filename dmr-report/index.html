        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The following is an analysis of
          <a href="https://company.dmr.co.jp/en">dmr!'s corporate website</a>.
          I first cover what I see as the main goals of the website. I then
          present several ideas I developed to better achieve these goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          To demonstrate some of the ideas I had for improving the website, I
          created <a href="http://tbroadley.github.io/dmr">a rebuilt version
          of the landing page</a>. My primary goal was to reduce the time it
          takes to load the page. I also replicated the functionality
          and UI features of the current website that I felt worked well.
          Finally, I implemented some of the changes that I suggest further on
          in this report.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="website-goals">
        <h2>Goals of the Website</h2>

        <p>
          The main goal of dmr!'s corporate website is to present information
          to potential internship applicants, and get them interested in the
          company. To this end, it includes information on current staff
          members, interviews and testimonials from former interns,
          a description of the job opportunity, and a form through which
          applications can be submitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another goal is to present a history of the company
          and the changes it has undergone since its inception. The website
          includes a timeline of the company, as well as essays written by
          company executives, describing the history of the company and how
          it recently pivoted to a new business model.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="uniqueness">
        <h2>Uniqueness</h2>

        <p>
          The main page of the website
          do not do a good job of describing what sets dmr! apart
          from other companies. For example,
          The images and text on the landing page
          could be found on any corporate
          website. I therefore replaced them with images and excerpts from the
          essays written by dmr! executives, and linked directly to them. These
          essays provide a much better characterization of the company,
          describing the difficult circumstances that dmr! has survived.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of the uniqueness of their content, I thought that the
          strongest portions of
          the website were the essays mentioned above,
          the timeline of the company's history, and the interview with two
          interns. I believe that
          these pages should be featured more prominently on the website.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="hidden-content">
        <h2>Hidden Content</h2>

        <p>
          Some of the most important content, such as the
          internship application form,
          is hidden in a dropdown menu on the landing page.
          To make it more obvious that dmr! offers internships,
          I included a direct link to the internship
          application on the landing page.
          I also made it clear in the landing page's description of the
          company that dmr! is interested in hiring interns from abroad.
        </p>

        <p>
          The reviews section,
          which I found the most compelling feature of the site, is also not
          immediately available on the front page. As mentioned above,
          I included direct links to these pages on the rebuilt landing page.
        </p>

        <p>
          I changed the names of some of the dropdown menu items, as well
          as the captions on the images at the bottom of the screen. These new
          captions are intended to better describe the pages that they link to,
          and give prospective interns and site visitors a better idea of their
          contents.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, I
          changed the all-caps text on the landing page to be normally
          capitalized, as all-capital print is more difficult to read.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="page-load">
        <h2>Page Load</h2>

        <p>
          The website is very slow to load, and downloads a large amount
          of data. This makes it difficult to view the page, especially when
          not much bandwidth is available
          (for example, when using a smartphone with cellular
          data). Impatient users may navigate away from the site before any
          content is displayed.
        </p>

        <p>
          By rebuilding the landing page, I drastically improved page load time
          while reducing the amount of data downloaded.
        </p>

                </td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
        </div>

        <p>
          I cannot guarantee
          that the numbers in the above table will be accurate when accessing
          the two websites from Japan. Since the dmr! website is hosted in
          Japan, and the rebuilt website is hosted in the United States,
          it may take longer for the rebuilt website to load.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some of the reduction in page load time comes from shrinking the
          total page size. This was accomplished by using smaller images, and
          by removing unused CSS and JavaScript source files.
        </p>

        <p>
          The number of HTTP requests also affects page load time.
          The original page downloads 28 JavaScript files and 19 CSS
          files. The rebuilt page downloads none of these. All of the CSS
          is included inline, in a
          <span class="code">style</span> tag in the HTML document itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I rebuilt the website using just HTML and CSS, similar
          gains could be made while still using WordPress. One key is to reduce
          the size of the images that the site downloads. The other important
          optimization is
          removing large JavaScript and CSS files. At the least, these files
          should be combined into one large file or included in the HTML file
          itself, reducing the number of HTML requests for external resources.

        <p>
          Thank you for taking the time to read this analysis of the
          dmr! corporate website. I would appreciate any feedback that you might
          have. I also hope that some of the suggestions made in this report
          may be implemented in the actual website.
