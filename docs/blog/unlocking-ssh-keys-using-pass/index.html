        <h1>Unlocking SSH keys using <code>pass</code></h1>
        <p class="timestamp"></p>
      </header>

      <section>
        <p>
          I use
          <a href="https://www.passwordstore.org/"><code>pass</code></a> as my
          password manager. It stores passwords and other secrets as
          GPG-encrypted files in a Git repository. I host that repo on GitHub
          and have clones of it on my work and personal computers. I store
          nearly all of my personal passwords in <code>pass</code>, including
          passwords for my GitHub SSH keys. I’ve gone through three ways of
          unlocking these SSH keys.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started by running <code>pass -c SSH/Ubuntu</code> to copy my SSH
          key’s password to the keyboard, running a Git command like
          <code>git push</code>, then pasting my password into the prompt. I
          wasn’t satisfied with how much typing this process required. Plus,
          sometimes I’d forget to copy the password to my clipboard before
          running the Git command. I’d have to Ctrl+C that command and rerun it
          after copying the password. Even though I used
          <code>ssh-agent</code> and wasn’t unlocking my SSH key that often, I
          decided to automate this process.
        </p>

        <p>
          My second method used a script I called <code>sshpass</code>. Here it
          is in its entirety:
        </p>

        <pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect -f
set password [exec pass SSH/Ubuntu]

spawn ssh-add
expect "passphrase"
send -- "$password\r"
interact</code></pre>

        <p>
          This is an <code>expect</code> script. According to
          <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/expect">its man page</a>,
          <code>expect</code> is “a program that ‘talks’ to other interactive
          programs according to a script”. In this case, the script instructs
          <code>expect</code> to store the output of
          <code>pass SSH/Ubuntu</code> in the variable <code>password</code>,
          then run <code>ssh-add</code>, wait for it to prompt for a password,
          and write the password to <code>ssh-add</code>’s stdin. For reasons I
          don’t totally understand, the <code>interact</code> command, which
          attaches the terminal’s standard streams to <code>ssh-add</code>’s, is
          necessary to let <code>ssh-add</code> finish running.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, all I had to do was run <code>sshpass</code> before running a Git
          command, but I’d still sometimes forget to run <code>sshpass</code>.
          Finally, this week, I came across a third solution that addresses this
          issue on Linux, mainly based on
          <a
            href="https://blog.ona.io/technology/2020/03/02/using-password-manager-with-ssh.html"
            >this blog post</a
          >.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, I added <code>AddKeysToAgent yes</code> to my SSH configuration
          at <code>~/.ssh/config</code>. This causes <code>ssh</code> to add
          keys to <code>ssh-agent</code> when they’re unlocked. This is
          important because we’ll no longer be explicitly calling
          <code>ssh-add</code>.
        </p>

        <p>Then, I added the following to my <code>.zshrc</code>:</p>

        <pre><code>eval $(ssh-agent) > /dev/null
export SSH_ASKPASS=~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash
alias ssh="setsid -w ssh"
alias git="setsid -w git"</code></pre>

        <p>
          This starts an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code>, then sets the
          <code>SSH_ASKPASS</code> environment variable. If this variable is
          set, when <code>ssh</code> needs a password to unlock an SSH key, it
          runs the script pointed at by the variable and uses the output as the
          password. Note that this only works if <code>ssh</code> isn’t run in a
          terminal. That’s the purpose of the aliases for <code>ssh</code> and
          <code>git</code>: <code>setsid</code> runs these programs in a new
          shell session that isn’t associated with the terminal in which I’m
          running <code>ssh</code> or <code>git</code>. The <code>-w</code> flag
          causes <code>setsid</code> to wait until <code>ssh</code> or
          <code>git</code> exits before exiting.
        </p>

        <p>
          <code>~/ssh-pass-passphrase.bash</code> is a script that writes my SSH
          key’s password to stdout:
        </p>

        <pre><code>#!/bin/bash
pass SSH/Ubuntu</code></pre>

        <p>
          Now, I can run Git commands without worrying if my SSH key is unlocked
          beforehand. If it isn’t, <code>ssh</code> automatically calls
          <code>pass</code> to get my SSH key’s password and unlocks the key
          before Git runs the command.
        </p>

        <p>
          So far, this setup only works on Ubuntu on my personal computer. My
          next step is to get it working on Mac OS, so I can use it on my work
          computer too. After that, I’d like to look into ways to avoid spawning
          an instance of <code>ssh-agent</code> in every terminal I run this
          command in.
