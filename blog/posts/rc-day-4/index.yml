  I spent a lot of the day trying to understand how [`quine-central`](https://github.com/dpiponi/quine-central) works. I think I got there! I published [a post](../understanding-quine-central-quine-loops) explaining how the programs generated by `quine-central` work and I’ve started one that summarizes how `quine-central` generates them.

  Along the way I made a few small improvements to my blog-generating software. I decided I much preferred the blogchain navigation I’d added over simply linking to a page with all posts under a tag, so I converted all posts with tags to use the former. (See the “RC Mini 7, 2020” above this post for an example.)

  In the morning I had another coffee chat and one last discussion about code review, then started synthesizing the feedback from all those discussions. I hope to present my findings at the technical talks at the end of the day tomorrow.

  Finally, I paired again on [`cssc`](https://github.com/stephen/cssc). We added support for reducing one species of multi-term `calc` expression, ones like `calc(100% - 10px - 10px)` that have multiple terms with the same units next to each other. I might pair again tomorrow to get `cssc` to handle expressions like `calc(100px - 10% - 10px)` where the terms with the same units are separated.

  Tomorrow I’ll also pair on Literate Diffs, work on a tech talk, and wrap up that second blog post on `quine-central`. It’s hard to believe tomorrow’s the last day of my batch. I’m going to get as much as I can out of my remaining time, then think about how I’d like to continue being a part in the RC community afterwards.
