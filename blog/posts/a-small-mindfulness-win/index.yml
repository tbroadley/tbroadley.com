    Yesterday I participated in a discussion group over voice chat. It was
    the first time in a couple of months that I’d had a real conversation
    with people I hadn’t met before. Making more friends is a goal of
    mine, but I often feel prevented from achieving that goal by social
    anxiety. Yesterday was no exception. When I woke up in the morning, I
    was already thinking about bailing on the discussion group.

    In the past, I’ve found that doing fulfilling solo activities helps me
    counteract this anxiety. So yesterday morning I did yoga, meditated,
    went on a bike ride to a park, cooked lunch, and sang. Even after all
    that, I was still feeling anxious about ten minutes before the
    meeting. As the meeting started, I saw the list of people in the voice
    chat room and felt intimidated by its size. I nearly let myself bail
    on the discussion group.

    Luckily, I took the opportunity to practice mindfulness. I took some
    deep breaths, closed my eyes, and focused on how I was feeling
    physically. I immediately noticed that my anxiety had manifested as a
    pit in my stomach. I focused on that sensation as well as I could and
    after a couple of minutes it mostly went away. I felt much calmer and,
    after a couple more minutes, I was able to join the voice chat room.
    I’m so glad I did. The discussion group was the highlight of my week.

    I hope I’ll remember to use this technique more in the future. I think
    I can apply it not just to social anxiety but also my tendency to
    procrastinate.
